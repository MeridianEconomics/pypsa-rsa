version,--,0.x.x,"Version of PyPSA-ZA"
tutorial,bool,"{true, false}","Switch to retrieve the tutorial data set instead of the full data set."
logging,,,
-- level,--,"Any of {'INFO', 'WARNING', 'ERROR'}","Restrict console outputs to all infos, warning or errors only"
-- format,--,"","Custom format for log messages. See `LogRecord <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.LogRecord>`_ attributes."
summary_dir,--,"e.g. 'results'","Directory into which results are written."
regions,--,"Subset of {'RSA', '9-supply', '10-supply', '27-supply'}","Number of nodes to resolve the model to."
-- build_topology,bool,"{true, false}","Switch to build the base network into specific regions via the rule :mod:`build_topology` or whether to keep use a pre-build base network."
-- build_cutout,bool,"{true, false}","Switch to enable the building of cutouts via the rule :mod:`build_cutout`."
-- use_eskom_wind_solar,bool,"{true, false}","Model defaults to Eskom hourly pu profiles for all wind and solar generators via :mod:`add_electricity`."
-- use_excel_wind_solar,bool,"{true, false}","Model defaults to excel input hourly pu profiles for all wind and solar generators."
-- build_natura_raster,bool,"{true, false}","Switch to enable the creation of the raster ``natura.tiff`` via the rule :mod:`build_natura_raster`."
-- build_renewable_profiles,bool,"{true, false}","Switch to enable calculation of renewable profiles using atlite and Global Wind Atlas."
-- custom_busmap,bool,"{true, false}","Switch to enable the use of custom busmaps in rule :mod:`cluster_network`. If activated the rule looks for provided busmaps at ``data/custom_busmap_elec_s{simpl}_{clusters}.csv`` which should have the same format as ``resources/busmap_elec_s{simpl}_{clusters}.csv``, i.e. the index should contain the buses of ``networks/elec_s{simpl}.nc``."
